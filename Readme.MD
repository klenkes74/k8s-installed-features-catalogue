## Abstract
A small definition for creating a catalogue of installed features on a
Kuberenetes cluster. Kubernetes is very flexible. Flexible to the extend that
you never know which features are enabled or installed.

## License
The license for the software is LGPL 3.0 or newer. 



## A note from the author
If someone is interested in getting it faster, we may team up. I'm open for that. But be warned: I want to do it 
_right_. So no short cuts to get faster. And be prepared for some basic discussions about the architecture or software 
design :-).
